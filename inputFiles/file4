Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam' and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin' out on anybody who try to say somethin' one thing about it
Got a problem, I got the same one
Money rolls, we fold
Plenty clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs\ Our cars don't even lose control
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud\n
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now

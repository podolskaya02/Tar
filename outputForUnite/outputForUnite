// PACKED WITH TAR //

// FILENAME: file1 //
Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam' and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin' out on anybody who try to say somethin' one thing about it
Got a problem, I got the same one
// END OF FILE //

// FILENAME: file2 //
The same code
Never turn our backs, our cars don't even lose control
// END OF FILE //

// FILENAME: file3 //
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
// END OF FILE //
